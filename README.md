# 👋 Hey there, I'm feevlic !  

My real name is [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-boudnik-3021a426a/), a mobile Engineer based in Germany. 

I like to design, build and explore whatever I can imageing. 

Not everything is related to mobile apps, somethimes I love pulling ideas from outside the mobile world and adapting them for better mobile (and mobility) experiences

My main tech stack outside of my position is Kotlin with Jetpack compose. My favoriute tools are Excalidraw to draw ideas, Android Studio or Visual Studio Code for developing.

Most of my ideas does not make it into my repos but they will never be forgotten because they shape my next idea.
