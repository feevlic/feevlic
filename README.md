# 👋 Hey there, I'm feevlic !  

My real name is [Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-boudnik-3021a426a/), I am an engineer based in Germany. 

I enjoy designing, building and exploring whatever I can imagine. 

Not everything I do is related to mobile apps. Sometimes I like to pull ideas from outside the mobile world and adapt them to create better mobile (and mobility) experiences.

Outside of my main tasks, I like to explore other software topics to familiarise myself with new technologies. 

Most of my ideas do not make it into my repos, but they will never be forgotten because they influence my future ideas.
